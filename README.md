Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

Hi! This is where I chose to store the files for the Capstone Project : How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success? 

This readme file will serve as the main directory for the other files as well as the "too long to read" (TLTR) section for the project,
wherein I provide my answers to the guide questions and explain some methodologies used for the project. :) 

First things first: The directory. Please note that these files are located right above this readme file.

(1) Data Cleaning Report.txt - As the name suggests, it is the data cleaning log I made for the whole Prepare and process phase. 

(2) Cyclistic - Bikeshare.pptx - Contains all the data visualizations I prepared from the analysis.

(3) 20230129_bike_share.sql - the SQL queries used for the data cleaning and extracting data for further analysis and viz in Microsoft Excel. 

----------------------------

Now, for the Data Analysis Process (Ask - Prepare - Process - Analyze - Share - Act)
