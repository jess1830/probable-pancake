----GOOGLE DATA ANALYTICS CAPSTONE PROJECT--------DATA CLEANING REPORT----PROJECT / DATASET DETAILSData Source: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.htmlLicense: https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreementRAW data format : CSVTools used:	- pgAdmin4 (postgreSQL)	- MS Excel (for viz and further analysis)	- MS Powerpoint (to consolidate viz , recommendations)**Note: This skips to STEP 4 of the SQL query since this is where the verificationsteps start. STEP 4 - Check if all rows of each table were included in the combined table	Result:		total rows from 4 tables = 3818004		total combined count from new = 381004	Remarks:		All rows accounted for. STEP 5 - Check for NULL values in each column and record. Check how this might affect further analysis.	Result: (total rows = 3818004)		gender = 559206 NULL VALUES (16.65% of total rows)		birthyear = 538751 NULL VALUES (14.11% of total rows)		the rest of the columns = 0 NULL VALUES	Remarks:		- gender column might not be used for analysis.		- birthyear to be inspected further for accuracy. 		STEP 5a - Inspecting birthyear column further:	Result: 		- Ages (2022 - birthyear) range from 8 to 263		- No. of entries with ages > 95 = 1033 (0.027%)	Remarks:		If age distribution is to be analyzed, do not include rows with age > 95. STEP 6 - Check for duplicates from trip_id, since this should not have any		Result:		- Distinct Values = 3818004		- Current Values = 3818004	Remarks:		No duplicate values found for trip_id.STEP 7 - Check for duplicates from station names, the distinct values of the names and the id's should be equal	Result:		to_sta_id = 617		to_station name = 641		variance = 24				from_sta_id = 616		from_sta_name = 640		variance = 24	Remarks: 		There are 24 station id's which have 2 or more station names assigned to it. Inspect further.STEP 7a - Inspecting the station id's and names further: 		Result:		- There are Station names repeated with added characters at the end of the string. 		- The characters are (temp) and (*)	Remarks:		- This might skew the analysis for the no. of trips per route, or most station used if there are		  two names for the same station. The results would have to be divided among the two (or more)	Action:		- Export Distinct station name and station id values to spreadsheet for closer inspection.		- conduct further cleaning and create new table with no duplicate entries		- Import back to postgreSQL to be referenced using JOIN function during analysis. 		- It must be noted that for analysis involving station,		  it would be best to use station_id instead of station names. STEP 8 - Trip Duration - consistency of values	Result: 		- Existing trip_duration column not consistent with computed trip duration		- There are results with (-)Negative values for trip duration. End time < Start time	Remarks: 		- Drop rows with negative values for computed trip duration as recommended by stakeholders. 		- Use computed column moving forward with analysis. STEP 8a - Dropping entries with negative values for computed trip duration.		Result: 		- Removed 13 rows from table.-----------Data cleaning completed. Proceed to Analyze Phase. --------------  -----This section is for the additional data cleaning steps taken during analysis phase---------Add 1 - Dropped rows where to_station_id = 671. This is for maintenance trips and has trip durations of more than 1 day which skews results. 	Total rows removed: 157Add 2 - All trips with trip_duration > 86400 seconds / 1 day will be analyzed separately. Add 3 - Median is used instead of mean to obtain the average trip duration because this will not be greatly affected by outliers, which our data definitely has.
